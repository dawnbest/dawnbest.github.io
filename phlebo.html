    <h1>Objectives</h1>
    <p><b>Problem:</b> Hospital staff within and outside the laboratory are often called on to draw blood and collect other specimens for laboratory testing. In several facilities within the hospital, specimen collection requirement materials were out-of-date and/or static paper documents. Collecting a specimen correctly differs from test to test and errors can cause delays in diagnosis and patient care. Due to the speed in which advances in testing media and best-practices are developed, the documentation is in constant need of updating. Amending specimen requirement documents and distributing them via printout is time-consuming, costly, and inefficient.</p>
