    <p><b>Design and Development:</b> Initially an experiment in ways to get a group of friends together, online, Age of the Four Clans started as a small world on a Windows server. When it became clear that more people wanted to try the game, a new engine called Intersect was selected for the task, and work began on fleshing out the story and creating a better look and feel for the game. At peak, A4C enjoyed as many as one hundred players online, requiring dedicated hosting and a team of Game Masters to keep the peace and perform hotfixes.</p>
    <p>The game has gone through several changes through the years, initially developed on a browser-based JavaScript platform on a Windows machine, it was migrated to several different in-between iterations before landing on the Intersect engine. Its servers have also moved several times, from dedicated Windows machines owned by the developer to their current setup on a commercial-grade Linux (Ubuntu terminal) host. While not as popular as it once was, A4C is still accepting new players looking for a fun "grinder" game!</p>
